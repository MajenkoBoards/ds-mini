Extra Libraries
===============

These are links to extra libraries that you may need for some of
the example sketches. They aren't required for the hardware on the
DS Mini, however they may well be of some use.

You will need to download them manually or use `git submodule init`
if you cloned the repository using `git` to obtain them.
